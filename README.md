# Ophthalmic Biomarker Detection

This project focuses on the detection and analysis of ophthalmic biomarkers using digital image processing techniques. The system is designed to assist in the early detection and monitoring of eye-related conditions through automated image analysis.

## Project Overview

The project consists of two main notebooks:
1. `DIP_project_final.ipynb`: The final implementation of the digital image processing pipeline
2. `Ophthalmic_Biomarker.ipynb`: Initial development and experimentation notebook

## Features

- Advanced image preprocessing techniques for ophthalmic images
- Biomarker detection and segmentation
- Quantitative analysis of detected biomarkers
- Visualization of results

## Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Image processing libraries

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ParthBhandakkar/Ophthalmic-Biomarker-Detection-.git
cd Ophthalmic-Biomarker-Detection-
```

2. Install required dependencies
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage

1. Open either `DIP_project_final.ipynb` or `Ophthalmic_Biomarker.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
2. Follow the step-by-step implementation in the notebooks
3. Replace the sample images with your own ophthalmic images for analysis
